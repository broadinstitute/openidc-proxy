name: Bump, Tag, and Publish
# The purpose of the workflow is to:
#  1. Bump the version number and tag the release if not a PR
#  2. Build docker image and publish to GCR
#
# When run on merge to main, it tags and bumps the patch version by default. You can
# bump other parts of the version by putting #major, #minor, or #patch in your commit
# message.
#
# When run on a PR, it simulates bumping the tag and appends a hash to the pushed image.
#
# The workflow relies on github secrets:
# - GCR_PUBLISH_EMAIL - SA email for publishing to broad-dsp-gcr-public
# - GCR_PUBLISH_KEY_B64 - SA key (Base64-encoded JSON string) for publishing to broad-dsp-gcr-public
# - BROADBOT_TOKEN - the broadbot token, so we can avoid two reviewer rule on GHA operations
